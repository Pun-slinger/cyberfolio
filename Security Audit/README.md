# Security Audit Practice

This scenario is based on a fictional company called Botium Toys:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business with a single location that serves as its office, storefront, and warehouse. As its online sales have grown internationally, the IT department is under pressure to support global operations while ensuring security and compliance.

To address these concerns, the IT manager has initiated an internal IT audit using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). She has defined the audit’s scope and goals, listed IT-managed assets, and completed a risk assessment. The primary objectives are to strengthen infrastructure security, identify vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with regulations related to online payments and doing business in the EU (including GDPR). 

The task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
